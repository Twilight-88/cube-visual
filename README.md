## ðŸ§Š Project Description â€“ Floating 3D Cube

This project showcases a visually engaging 3D cube using pure HTML and CSS. The cube rotates continuously and appears to float in space, thanks to a dynamic glowing shadow beneath it. Each sideâ€”including the top faceâ€”features a seamless black-to-green gradient for a unified aesthetic. The glowing effect and animation deliver a sleek, futuristic vibe, ideal for UI experiments, web showcases, or creative portfolios.
